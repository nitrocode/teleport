# Per-session MFA

Teleport supports multi-factor authentication on every SSH and Kubernetes
"connection" (a single `tsh ssh` or `kubectl` call). This is an advanced
security feature that protects users against compromises of their on-disk
Teleport certificates.

<Admonition type="note">

  In addition to per-session MFA, enable login MFA in your SSO provider and/or
  for all [local Teleport
  users](../../setup/reference/authentication.mdx#local-no-authentication-connector)
  to improve security.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
  Per-session MFA checks were introduced in Teleport v6.1. To enforce the
  checks, you must update **all** `teleport` binaries in your deployment. If
  only Auth and Proxy services are updated, these checks will *not* be properly
  enforced. Additionally, only v6.1 or newer `tsh` binaries implement
  per-session MFA checks.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

- [WebAuthn configured](webauthn.mdx) on this cluster
- Second factor hardware device, such as YubiKey or SoloKey
- A Web browser with [WebAuthn support](
  https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/WebAuthn_Browser_Support/) (if using
  SSH from the Teleport Web UI).

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

<Admonition type="note" title="Per-session MFA with FIPS" scope="enterprise" scopeOnly>

Teleport FIPS builds disable local users. To configure WebAuthn in order to use
per-session MFA with FIPS builds, provide the following in your `teleport.yaml`:

```yaml
teleport:
  auth_service:
    local_auth: false
    second_factor: optional
    webauthn:
      rp_id: teleport.example.com
```
</Admonition>

## Configure per-session MFA

Per-session MFA can be enforced cluster-wide or only for some specific roles.

### Cluster-wide

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

To enforce MFA checks for all roles, edit your cluster authentication
configuration:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Static configuration">

Update `teleport.yaml` on the Auth Server to contain:

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    # require per-session MFA cluster-wide
    require_session_mfa: yes
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Dynamic resources">

Create a file called `cap.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  require_session_mfa: true
version: v2
```

Create the resource:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">

Create a file called `cap.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  require_session_mfa: true
version: v2
```

Create the resource:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
```

</ScopedBlock>

### Per role

To enforce MFA checks for a specific role, update the role to contain:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: example-role-with-mfa
spec:
  options:
    # require per-session MFA for this role
    require_session_mfa: true
  allow:
    ...
  deny:
    ...
```

Role-specific enforcement only applies when accessing SSH nodes or Kubernetes
clusters matching that role's `allow` section.

### Roles example

Let's walk though an example of setting up per-session MFA checks for roles.

Jerry is an engineer with access to the company infrastructure. The
infrastructure is split into development and production environments. Security
engineer Olga wants to enforce MFA checks for accessing production servers.
Development servers don't require this to reduce engineers' friction.

Olga defines two Teleport roles: `access-dev` and `access-prod`:

```yaml
# access-dev.yaml
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: access-dev
spec:
  allow:
    node_labels:
      env: dev
    kubernetes_labels:
      env: dev
  deny: {}
---
# access-prod.yaml
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: access-prod
spec:
  options:
    # require per-session MFA for production access
    require_session_mfa: true
  allow:
    node_labels:
      env: prod
    kubernetes_labels:
      env: prod
  deny: {}
```

Olga then assigns both roles to all engineers, including Jerry.

When Jerry logs into node `dev1.example.com` (with label `env: dev`), nothing
special happens:

```code
$ tsh ssh dev1.example.com

# jerry@dev1.example.com >
```

But when Jerry logs into node `prod3.example.com` (with label `env: prod`), he
gets prompted for an MFA check:

```code
$ tsh ssh prod3.example.com
# Tap any security key <tap>

# jerry@prod3.example.com >
```

If per-session MFA was enabled cluster-wide, Jerry would be prompted for MFA
even when logging into `dev1.example.com`.

<Admonition title="Per-session MFA for Database Access" type="tip">

Database Access supports per-connection MFA. When Jerry connects to the database
`prod-mysql-instance` (with label `env: prod`), he gets
prompted for an MFA check for each `tsh db connect` call:

```code
$ tsh db connect prod-mysql-instance
# Tap any security key

# Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
# Your MySQL connection id is 10002

```

## Limitations

Current limitations for this feature are:

- WebAuthn hardware devices aren't currently supported in `tsh` on Windows.
- Only `tsh ssh` supports per-session MFA authentication for SSH (OpenSSH `ssh`
  does not).
- Only `kubectl` supports per-session U2F authentication for Kubernetes.
- Database and Application access clients don't support per-session MFA
  authentication yet, although cluster and role configuration applies to them.
  If you enable per-session MFA checks cluster-wide, you will not be able to use
  Database or Application access. We're working on integrating per-session MFA
  checks for these clients.
